### Kitt a 1lb combat robot. 

This is my 1lb combat robot that I made. I made it to be semi simialer to a large robot called deep six which is a verticle spinner where the majority of weight is in the giant weapon, my weapon isnt quite as big but compared to some other robots in the same class its pretty big. I made this combat robot because I wanted to make the prodject because I though it would be a good challenge to make a full combat ant instead of just plastic ants like ive made before. 

# About the bot

All the main parts of the bot like the fram, uprights, forks, and armor will be 3d printed out of Overture easy nylon because it has a high strength and lower density then fillaments like pla and petg. The frame and uprights are going to be printed at 80% infil while the armor and forks are going to be solid. The weapon is going to be make out of ar500 steel.
