# May 24: Started researching and cading

I researched some ideas for what type of design i'm going to make and found some ones that I thought good ones and started cadding. I started with importing my motors and making a basic bottom to start with, then I started working of my upright design.
My idea for this design is to have a sort of wedge in the back to make it harder for people to hit me while having the front lead into the weapon.
