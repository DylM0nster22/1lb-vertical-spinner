# May 24: Started researching and cading

I researched some ideas for what type of design i'm going to make and found some ones that I thought good ones and started cadding. I started with importing my motors and making a basic bottom to start with, then I started working of my upright design.
My idea for this design is to have a sort of wedge in the back to make it harder for people to hit me while having the front lead into the weapon.

# May 25: More cading 

I started with making some basic walls and making it bigger, then I prototyped with different weapon designs before a relized the size of weapon i was trying to use wasnt feasable so then I used smaller ones. overall I didnt make much progress but did decide on a weapon type.. A axe.

Something like this design

This is my progress

# May 27: I fully decided what i was going to do

I finished thinking out fully what I was going to do, then I imported all the parts i would be using and arranged them how I am going to put them. I added the main part of it.. the color scheme, I also fully make the wedge and added all the screw holes for it to be attachable.

# May 28: I made the first version of my weapon and made some mounting holes

I followed a tutorial to help me make a asymmetrical weapon and keep the center of balance almost perfect. I also started making mounting holes for my uprights and had the idea to make the back upright screws be indented into the rear wedge for extra support. I also made supports for the top lid to be mounted.

# May 29: I rebalanced the weapon and made some design changes

Today I made some choices like changing out my repeat robotics mini mk4s for antweight tangent drive which I think is a better chice because of 2 factors, one is weight they weight about half the weight of the mk4s, and two the other reason is because with them i can run 4wd. I also changed the weapon to have the center of balance to be closer to the center and added pockets so the momentium can be transfered through the tip of the weapon easier and make it hit harder.

**Total time spend 1.5h**

# June 4: I setup the tangent proplerly and make basic forks

Today I properly alligned the wheels and axels for tangent drive by creating a cicle with the diameter of the wheel and moving it 0.3mm into the tangent axel so it would properly mesh. I also created basic forks and moved the wedge so it would be flush with the ground and actually act as a wedge. This was done during the roadtrip call.

**Total time spent 45m**

# June 16th i made some material choices for different parts and added armor and some other changes

Today I decided that instead of just printing everything other than the weapon that I was going to order the weapon uprights to be made from uhmw because its lighter and stronger than most printing, I also figured I would get the top plate cut out of carbon fiber. i also removed the wedge for weight reason because after weight calcuations without the wheels or forks i only had 40 grams left, I also added wheel armor thats going to be make out of tpu most likely.
