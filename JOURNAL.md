# May 24: Started researching and cading

I researched some ideas for what type of design i'm going to make and found some ones that I thought good ones and started cadding. I started with importing my motors and making a basic bottom to start with, then I started working of my upright design.
My idea for this design is to have a sort of wedge in the back to make it harder for people to hit me while having the front lead into the weapon.

# May 25: More cading 

I started with making some basic walls and making it bigger, then I prototyped with different weapon designs before a relized the size of weapon i was trying to use wasnt feasable so then I used smaller ones. overall I didnt make much progress but did decide on a weapon type.. A axe.

Something like this design

# May 27: I fully decided what i was going to do

I finished thinking out fully what I was going to do, then I imported all the parts i would be using and arranged them how I am going to put them. I added the main part of it.. the color scheme, I also fully make the wedge and added all the screw holes for it to be attachable.

# May 28: I made the first version of my weapon and made some mounting holes

I followed a tutorial to help me make a asymmetrical weapon and keep the center of balance almost perfect. I also started making mounting holes for my uprights and had the idea to make the back upright screws be indented into the rear wedge for extra support. I also made supports for the top lid to be mounted.
